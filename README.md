# Dressy-An Analytics App
The app allows the user to try the apparel, share it on facebook or share it on G+
Based on the actions the user performs we track the information like device, operating system, browser,
country,IP, date,time etc when the action was performed and store it in the backend.
Based on these we build piecharts and bar graphs to depict the appropriate information for the
merchants.
